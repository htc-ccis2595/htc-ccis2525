<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>
  This course is an introduction to programming in Java. Topics include fundamentals of Java programming, including object-oriented programming, primitive data types, control structures, methods, objects, classes, class inheritance, simple graphical user interface and event-driven programs using Swing. Oject-oriented design using the Unified Modeling Language will also be introduced.
</p>

<p>
  This course is an excellent course both in terms of work force relevance and continuing education. Java is widely used in industry and is syntactically very similar to many other popular languages such as C#, JavaScript and Ruby. Java is also widely used in educational settings and if you intend to earn a higher degree, this course may transfer to cover the introductory object oriented programming course common at many other institutions.
