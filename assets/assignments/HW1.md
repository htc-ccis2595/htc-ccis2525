# HW 1 ­ Functional Programming in Java
This week's homework includes reading and two coding exercises which are detailed below.

## Goals:

- Learn basic Java syntax for control and logic structures
- Create a new Java command line project in InteliJ
- Build and run a simple Java command line application
- Version the project in GitHub

## Reading & End of Chapter Exercises
Before beginning, you’ll want to read through Chapters 1 through 3 in your textbook. These chapters introduce basic Java language syntax for how to use program control and logic structures. We will use these throughout the semester, but will not be spending a lot of time on them in class.  It is assumed you already have a foundation in at least one other programming language and have worked with these basic program control and logic structures before.

You should be familiar with how to use conditional statements and boolean logic, if-elsestatements and the logical operators and, or, not, as well and control such as a <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loops. You should also understand how to work with strings and arrays (lists of items). These are the foundation of most programming languages and translate pretty easily between them. Once you learn one programming language, it’s generally pretty easy to apply what you know to learning the next.

As you complete each chapter, work through the Self Test Exercises at the end of each Chapter to measure what you have learned. The answers are in Appendix A at the back of the book, so you can evaluate and correct your work when you are done. If you have questions on anything covered, please ask. The class chat room will be an excellent spot to discuss these.


## Homework 1 - Part 1 - Counting Game

When teaching kids division, they often will play a word game where the students will sit in a circle and count up from 1 to some number (say 10 for example), but with a twist. If a number is divisible by another number, that number is replaced with a word.

Your first assignment is to write code for this number game in Java. Recall that you can tell if a number is divisible by another by using the modulus operator (%) which gives you the remainder from division.  If the result is zero (there is no remainder) then the first number is divisible by the second.

Assignment Details are found in the readme file in the GitHub repository.

### GitHub Info
Repository:  https://github.com/htc-ccis2595/counting-game

You need to fork this repository and submit a pull request to turn in the assignment.  Please post a screenshot of the pull request to the D2L dropbox.  The dropbox is mainly used to communicate due dates, not for storing the completed work.  You do not need to upload the project to D2L, only to GitHub.


## Homework 1 - Part 2 - 99 Bottles
The second part of the assignment is to write a program that will print out the lyrics to 99 Bottles.  Bottles of what?  Make a variable for what is in the bottle (so it can be easily changed) and start it out as “beer” or another beverage of your choice, if you’d rather.  

You will also want to have a variable for the initial number of bottles, as it gets tedious to scroll through 99 verses each time.  I recommend working with this set to 3 for starter, then changing it to 99 when you have everything working. Remember to update this, as I am expecting 99 Bottles, not 3 Bottles...

Assignment Details are found in the readme file in the GitHub repository.

### GitHub Info
Repository:  https://github.com/htc-ccis2595/counting-game

You need to fork this repository and submit a pull request to turn in the assignment.  Again, please post a screenshot of the pull request to the D2L dropbox.  There will be only one D2L dropbox for both parts of the assignment, so both screenshots will go to the same place.
